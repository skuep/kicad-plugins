# action_viafence
See [Example image](https://github.com/skuep/kicad-plugins/blob/master/action_viafence/tests/simple-test.png).

A via fencing plugin used to place fences of vias next to paths.
Copy the folder into ~/kicad_plugins/ or create a symlink to the the action_viafence folder.

The following libraries are required: pyclipper, wxPython, matplotlib and numpy (temporarily for visualization)

You can access the plugin via pcbnew->Tools->External Plugins->Via Fence Generator. 
It opens a dialog that lets you choose some options and where to get the input tracks from (nets, drawing lines). It then adds VIAs to your board file. However note that *currently*, no DRC check is made, so VIAs might end up on different-net objects, causing DRC problems. 

You can also run the plugin standalone by cd'ing into the parent folder (i.e. ~/.kicad_plugins/) and run

    $ python -m action_viafence --help # Show help 
    $ python -m action_viafence --verbose --test simple-test # starts the simple-test testcase and shows it on the screen
    $ python -m action_viafence --runtests # runs all test cases in the `tests` subdirectory
